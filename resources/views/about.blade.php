                            </div>
                            <p>Some may ask what inspired the
                                building of this house, well it was based on a Godly vision
                                for family and others. This vision is not unique, as it’s grounded in oneness... one mind,
                                one purpose, one objective, unity, love, and serving each other. As children of God, we're
                                asked to demonstrate it to the world....be lights of the world (something that can be seen),
                                and salt to the earth (something that can be experienced). So, we offer in that spirit, as
                                blood members but more importantly spiritual members... as scripture teaches us that we are
                                members of one another. You may agree with me or not, but it’s one thing to gather to
                                fellowship, eat, drink, laugh, and talk but it’s a whole different thing to walk together to
                                accomplish a goal or desired end. </p>
                            <p>
                                For us to succeed our agreements must define our relationship(s) and not our
                                difference(s).
                                We work to bridge our differences. After all the scriptures teach us "Blessed are the
                                peacemakers, for they will be called children of God." One way to fulfill this is if you
                                are
                                told your act or something you said offended (offender), whether you agree or not with
                                the
                                conclusion, you seek forgiveness, you shouldn't get stuck on “I'm innocent” – “I
                                did/said
                                anything wrong”. Now, this doesn’t prevent us from telling each other the truth about a
                                matter, we should be wise in our approach and do it with love and humility. Likewise, if
                                you
                                were offended by an act or by something said (victim), you acknowledge the pain and/or
                                hurt
                                but seek healing, understanding, and the purpose thru Jesus Christ, as you should never
                                get


                                stuck on mad/anger, because you don't want to give place to the devil... as it
                                ultimately
                                leads to bitterness, resentment, hatred, etc.… Scripture teaches us, to warn those who
                                are
                                unruly, comfort the fainthearted, uphold the weak, be patient with all. See that no one
                                renders evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue what is good both for yourselves and
                                for
                                all. Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, in everything give thanks; for this is the
                                will
                                of God in Christ Jesus for you. Do not quench the Spirit. Do not despise prophecies.
                                Test
                                all things; hold fast what is good. Abstain from every form of evil.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                By and in this spirit, we seek to reconcile (as scripture says, “You have heard that it
                                was
                                said to those of old, ‘You shall not murder, and whoever murders will be in danger of
                                the
                                judgment.’ But I say to you that whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall
                                be
                                in danger of the judgment. And whoever says to his brother, ‘Raca!’ shall be in danger
                                of
                                the council. But whoever says, ‘You fool!’ shall be in danger of hellfire. Therefore, if
                                you
                                bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against
                                you, leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First, be reconciled to
                                your
                                brother, and then come and offer your gift. Agree with your adversary quickly, while you
                                are
                                on the way with him, lest your

                                adversary delivers you to the judge, the judge hands you over to the officer, and you be
                                thrown into prison. Assuredly, I say to you, you will by no means get out of there till
                                you
                                have paid the last penny (Matthew 5:21‭-‬26), heal – forget the pain, and offer peace
                                (per
                                scripture "And the God of love and peace will be with you.") This oneness favors the
                                trinity: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit being three different
                                persons
                                but are one thru agreement. So, as a family, we can host get-togethers, do events,
                                business,
                                invite people to witness too, etc... but even more reconcile with those we felt wronged
                                us
                                in the family or in any other relationship thru Christ, heal - forget the pain it
                                caused, be
                                in perfect peace - to be unbothered by who is around you or what others say or do. As
                                scripture tells us God will keep us in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on Him
                                because we
                                trust in Him.‬‬‬

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To this end, we should make everything about God/Jesus and not ourselves. This helps us
                                to
                                not take things personally because nothing is truly about you or me but it’s about Jesus
                                and
                                us pleasing and glorifying God or not. Scriptures tell us “If the world hates you, you
                                know
                                that it hated Me before it hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love its
                                own. Yet because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore
                                the
                                world hates you. Remember the word that I said to you, ‘A servant is not greater than
                                his
                                master.’ If they persecuted Me, they would also persecute you. If they kept My word,
                                they
                                would keep yours also. But all these things they will do to you for My name’s sake
                                because
                                they do not know Him who sent Me. But this happened that the word might be fulfilled
                                which
                                is written in their law, ‘They hated Me without a cause.’
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Finally, we say to friends and strangers we would like to offer and extend a
                                demonstration
                                of blood/spiritual members walking together to offer to you the opportunity to stay at
                                this
                                house, host small events (15-20 ppl), and have access to ATVs, swimming at blue springs,
                                catering, visit the local cave, and much more. We know most would consider this a remote
                                location, well the benefit of that is it allows you to unplug, retreat, unwind from the
                                various noise, and position yourself to hear.... some may even argue quietness can be
                                therapeutic. At any rate, we would like to invite you into our family vision and offer
                                you
                                this experience at the house.

                                the council. But whoever says, ‘You fool!’ shall be in danger of hellfire. Therefore, if you
                                bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against
                                you, leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First, be reconciled to your
                                brother, and then come and offer your gift. Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are
                                on the way with him, lest your

                            </p>
                            <p>adversary delivers you to the judge, the judge hands you over to the officer, and you be
                                thrown into prison. Assuredly, I say to you, you will by no means get out of there till you
                                have paid the last penny (Matthew 5:21‭-‬26), heal, and offer peace (as scripture also
                                teaches "And the God of love and peace will be with you.") This oneness favors the trinity:
                                God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit being three different persons but are
                                one thru agreement. So, as a family, we can host get-togethers, do events, business, invite
                                people to witness too, etc... but even more reconcile with those we felt wronged us in the
                                family or in any other relationship thru Christ, heal - forget the pain it caused, be in
                                perfect peace - to be unbothered by who is around you or what others say or do. As scripture
                                tells us God will keep us in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on Him because we trust in
                                Him.‬‬‬

                                We should make everything about God/Jesus and not ourselves. This helps us to not take
                                things personally because nothing is truly about you or me but it’s about Jesus and us
                                pleasing and glorifying God or not. Scriptures tell us “If the world hates you, you know
                                that it hated Me before it hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love its
                                own. Yet because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the
                                world hates you. Remember the word that I said to you, ‘A servant is not greater than his
                                master.’ If they persecuted Me, they would also persecute you. If they kept My word, they
                                would keep yours also. But all these things they will do to you for My name’s sake because
                                they do not know Him who sent Me. But this happened that the word might be fulfilled which
                                is written in their law, ‘They hated Me without a cause.’

                                Finally, we say to friends, family, and guests we would like to present and extend a
                                demonstration of blood/spiritual members walking together to offer to you the opportunity to
                                stay at HIG proprty, host small events (15-20 ppl), and have access to ATVs, swimming at
                                blue springs, visit the cave, and much more. Now most would consider this a remote location,
                                the benefit of it is it allows you to unplug, unwind from the noise, and position yourself
                                to hear.... some may argue quietness can be therapeutic.
